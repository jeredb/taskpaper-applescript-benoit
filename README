Hi! This is Jered. These are some of the AppleScripts that I have created to work with [TaskPaper](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/wiki/TaskPaper).

Want to learn more about [TaskPaper](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/wiki/TaskPaper), head over to [Hog Bay Software](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/).

These scripts work best with [FastScripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/) from [Red Sweater Software](http://www.red-sweater.com/)

## Convert to Task

Converts currently selected TaskPaper entry to a task type entry

## Convert to Note

Converts currently selected TaskPaper entry to a note type entry

## Convert to Project

Converts currently selected TaskPaper entry to a project type entry

## Create Taskpaper Task

Grabs URL and selected text from Safari and adds the URL as a task type entry with a date stamp and adds selected text as note type entry.

## Notes:

Most of these scripts are probably crap, but they work for me.
